  <Card title="Developer-first" icon="brackets-curly">
    Taking a bottom-up approach, everything we build is designed with developers
    in mind. Each addition is carefully considered to avoid enabling toxic
    managerial practices, aiming to create a space where developers can
    flourish, innovate and remain accountable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Continuous Improvement" icon="seedling">
    Just like the developers we serve, we are committed to continuous
    improvement. We own our mistakes and acknowledge that, like everyone, we are
    prone to them. We iterate on our products based on user feedback, emerging
    trends, and new technology to ensure we are always at the cutting edge.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simple and effective" icon="crosshairs">
    Our commitment is to deliver solutions that are both powerful and easy to
    use. We design our tools with simplicity in mind, ensuring they are
    intuitive and user-friendly. By focusing on essential features and
    minimizing unnecessary complexity, we empower our users to drive their
    teams' success efficiently and effectively.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transparency and Trust" icon="shield">
    We believe in open communication and honesty. Our processes, decisions, and
    code are open for scrutiny, fostering trust within our community and among
    our users. Additionally, all data visible to a manager is also accessible to
    developers, ensuring transparency and preventing data silos. This openness
    helps build a collaborative environment where trust and accountability are
    paramount.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Community-Driven" icon="users">
    Our community is at the heart of everything we do. We actively seek out and
    incorporate community feedback, and we support open-source initiatives that
    benefit the wider developer ecosystem.
