## Insights

This chart can help you measure and answer questions like:

- Are Pull Requests reviewed promptly?
- Are code reviews a bottleneck?
- Are the recent process changes effective?
- Are there any recurring patterns or periodic fluctuations?

## What good looks like

Ideally, most small Pull Requests should be reviewed within hours of its creation. Team members should prioritize moving together as a team over their own individual work.

## How to improve

There are some strategies that can help your team's time to first review.

- Visit this data during retrospectives and discuss options with the team.
- Strive for smaller Pull Requests.
- Automate the process as much as you can.
- Make it clear to the team that reviewing code is a priority.
- Simplify your reviewer assigning process.
